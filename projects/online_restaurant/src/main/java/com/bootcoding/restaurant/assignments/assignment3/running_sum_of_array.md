## Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

### Example 1:

```sh
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```

### Example 2:
```sh
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
```

### Example 3:
```sh
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```


### Define a method as mentioned below
### Call it from main() method by passing hard-coded array as argument as given above.
```sh 
public int[] runningSum(int[] nums){
      // Write logic here
}
```
