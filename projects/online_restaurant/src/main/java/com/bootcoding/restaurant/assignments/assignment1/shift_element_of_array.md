# Shifting all 0's to the end of array


Given an integer array numbers, move all zeros to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: numbers = [0,10,0,30,20]
Output: [10,30,20,0,0]
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: numbers = [0,0,0,30,20]
Output: [30,20,0,0,0]
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: numbers = [0,0,1,00]
Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
```

### Define a method as mentioned below
### Call it from main() method by passing hard-coded array as argument as given above.
```sh 
public void moveZeroes(int[] numbers) {
      // Write logic here
}
```
